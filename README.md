# Webpack TypeScript Template

Just clone the repo, and begin editing the code however you like.

Only transpiles TypeScript, and does not support code splitting.

My primary motivation for this repo was to be quickly bootstrap either a [PixiJS](https://www.pixijs.com/) or a [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) app. Therefore, I did not see any motivation to use code splitting. I may, however, consider Sass support, later.
